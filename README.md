The following is the first iteration of a context scenario for a primary persona for a campus interactive directory, including both the device and its service. Our persona is Aina, a FCM student in Multimedia University, whose goal to achieve excellent result on her studies in Advertising Design course.

Here is Aina's context scenario:

1. After the morning class, Aina would like to meet Madam Tengku for her class assignment consultation, but unfortunately she forgets the lecturer’s room number. She walks to FCM building’s ground floor counter to search for interactive directory. While she key in the lecturer’s name into search button, the directory immediately come out the page about lecturer’s room and also other details information about lecturer. In the lecturer page, it shows a red light icon which is offline status, so Aina decides to walk in consultation after an hour.
2. When Aina click into news button, the directory screen pop up some event news that happening around MMU campus. After reads the information, she realizes that this week is business week for FIT students at central plaza, she decides to walk to the place to solve her lunch meal later soon.
3. Aina incidentally view MMU announcement from directory kiosk, she found that next week is final financial clearance and settlement from a reminder article. Then, she contacts her parents for tuition fees settlement notice. 
4. After consultation, Aina wants to do revision in library.

After knowing there is crowded, Aina walks back her hostel for own revision and could save energy for walking to library check situation.
