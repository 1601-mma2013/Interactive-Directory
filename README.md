### c. Stakeholder Interviews (internal / external)
Understand product vision and constraints

Product{project} Vision 
- to ensure the increases of productivity of the student by increasing their efficiency of receiving and gaining information about MMU and their respective faculty

Risk
- Someone may vandalize or steal part of the kiosks 
   - *(can be prevent by using safer material to cover the kiosk but it will add on financial constraints because it is very expensive)*
- Internal or External parts of the system may stop working or malfunction
    - *(it may not work due to some internal technical issues that can be solved by hiring technician to maintain the kiosk but it will add up on financial constraints because we need to pay the technician and the replacement for the damaged parts)*
- Software may have some bug and error
    - *(can be solved by hiring programmer to handle the software system but it will add up on financial constraints because we need to pay the programmer)*
- Stop functioning if blackout happen in the campus because the system required electricity and internet access to function
    - *(can be solved by doing alternate wiring for the kiosk and directed it to backup generator other than main generator)*

Obstacles
-To ensure the safety of the product from vandalizing or loss of the parts due to the set-up in the open space

Constraints 
- Very high budget setup 
           -*(using too many electronic parts and need high-quality material to build the kiosk to prevent loss and damage from internal and external sources)*
- Too many equipment involved for the development of this system and will increase the budget needed for this system

Opportunities 
-	Can generate income for MMU by including paid advertisement 
            - *(when the kiosk is in idle mode, the advertisement will pop out so that passerby can view the ads)*
-	To improve MMU image as first campus to provide interactive directory technology service to university users
           - *(So far there are no other universities in Malaysia provide interactive map for their students, visitors, staffs and lecturers)*

The following is the first iteration of a context scenario for a primary persona for a campus interactive directory, including both the device and its service. Our persona is Aina, a FCM student in Multimedia University, whose goal to achieve excellent result on her studies in Advertising Design course.

Here is Aina's context scenario:

1. After the morning class, Aina would like to meet Madam Tengku for her class assignment consultation, but unfortunately she forgets the lecturer’s room number. She walks to FCM building’s ground floor counter to search for interactive directory. While she key in the lecturer’s name into search button, the directory immediately come out the page about lecturer’s room and also other details information about lecturer. In the lecturer page, it shows a red light icon which is offline status, so Aina decides to walk in consultation after an hour.
2. When Aina click into news button, the directory screen pop up some event news that happening around MMU campus. After reads the information, she realizes that this week is business week for FIT students at central plaza, she decides to walk to the place to solve her lunch meal later soon.
3. Aina incidentally view MMU announcement from directory kiosk, she found that next week is final financial clearance and settlement from a reminder article. Then, she contacts her parents for tuition fees settlement notice. 
4. After consultation, Aina wants to do revision in library. She worries library will be full and noisy will affect her quality of studies, so Aina seek for interactive directory to know library situation now. After knowing there is crowded, Aina walks back her hostel for own revision and could save energy for walking to library check situation.
